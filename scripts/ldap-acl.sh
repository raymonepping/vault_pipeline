# scripts/ldap-acl.sh (identity-up runs it): the directory's access rules,
# from vault_dance. Applied over ldapi:// inside vpip-openldap (SASL EXTERNAL
# as the container's root: the only way to change cn=config). The whole
# olcAccess list is replaced in a known order, so a run is idempotent.
#   passwords   a person may change their own; anyone may bind with one
#               (auth); nobody may read one
#   everything  admin writes; keycloak-bind (Keycloak's federation) reads;
#               signed-in people read; anonymous sees nothing
# Without the last rule osixia's default hides ou=people from keycloak-bind,
# and every sign-in fails with "Invalid username or password" (found on the
# first sign-in, prompt 12).
